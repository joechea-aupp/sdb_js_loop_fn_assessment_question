/**
You are required to write a JavaScript function named fizzBuzzList that takes in an array of integers and 
returns a new array where each element follows the FizzBuzz rules. FizzBuzz is a simple game where you iterate 
through a sequence of numbers and, for each number in the sequence, you should:

- Replace the number with "Fizz" if it's divisible by 3.
- Replace the number with "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5.
- Replace the number with "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Keep the number unchanged if it's not divisible by 3 or 5.

Write the fizzBuzzList function with the following specifications:

- Function Name: fizzBuzzList
- Parameter: list (an array of integers)
- Return: A new array where each element follows the FizzBuzz rules.

Example usage:

console.log(fizzBuzzList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]));
// Output: [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz"]

Additional Instructions:

- Your function should be able to handle any array of integers.
- Ensure proper commenting to explain the purpose and functionality of your function.
- Test your function with different arrays to verify its correctness.
