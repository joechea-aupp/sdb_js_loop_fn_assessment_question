/**
 * Write a JavaScript function named replaceLastWithFirst that takes in an array of integers and replaces the last element with the first one. 
 * If the list is empty or has only one element, it should remain unchanged.

Instructions:

1. Create a function named replaceLastWithFirst that takes one parameter:

    -arr (an array of integers) - This parameter represents the input array in which the last element is to be replaced with the first one.

2. Inside the function:

    - If the input array arr is empty or has only one element, return the array as is.
    - Otherwise, remove the last element from the array and store it in a variable.
    - Insert the stored last element at the beginning of the array.
    - Return the modified array.

Example:

Input:

replaceLastWithFirst([2, 3, 4, 1]);

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
 */

function replaceLastWithFirst(arr) {
  // your answer here!
}

module.exports = replaceLastWithFirst;
